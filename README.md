# Stellar-Sync
Stellar Sync is a celestial themed application which provides users with insights about their zodiac sign and other personalized topics based on their birthdate. Individuals seeking personalized recommendations and affirmations rooted in astrology will be provided with ample information about themselves and their friends. Upon registration, users provide their birthdate which is then used to generate information about their zodiac sign. From this, users can view their account information including a brief description of the attributes of their sign, a personalized affirmation, and three song recommendations specifically curated for the user. The daily affirmation and songs are both generated based on the user’s specific signs through calls to the OpenAi API on every login. Beyond profile information, users can navigate to a search page to search for other users based on username and have the option to become friends with them. Added friends will then be displayed in a list with basic profile information on the user that added them’s friends page titled friends. As a whole, the application provides users with personalized zodiac information across a seamless interface with an artistic cosmic presentation.
